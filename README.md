# Seunghu Kim | Urban Designer

Welcome to my portfolio!  

I am deeply passionate about creating meaningful dialogue between humans and nature, crafting narratives for urban resilience, and addressing the appropriate scale for urban design and implementation. My work has primarily focused on waterfronts, exploring ways to redefine humanâ€™s relationship with nature. This begins with asking the right questions about scale and developing narratives that stimulate urban discourse, challenge complacency, and communicate the urgency of our built environment in the midst of the climate crisis.
