          <strong>Daylighting Democracy: Repairing Tibbetts Brook</strong><br>
          <p>This proposal frames the daylighting of Tibbetts Brook, a long-buried Bronx stream, as not only ecological restoration but also civic repair. To unearth the brook is to unearth 
            relationships—treating dismantling itself as design: confronting histories of neglect and inequity while bringing suppressed narratives back into the light. Daylighting becomes 
            more than restoration; it is an act of environmental justice and democratic repair that reclaims ownership, dignity, and belonging for the Bronx, while reminding us that repair 
            is as architectural as building itself.</p><br>
